# Working-professional-data-survey
This dataset is based on a survey done between individuals in data careers, such as analysts, engineers, and scientists. This will help to understand the key metrics that the overall people hold to build their career in data roles.

# Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze survey data collected from data professionals to uncover insights about their roles, career paths, satisfaction levels, challenges, and preferences. The analysis will focus on identifying trends in salary ranges, career transitions, industry distribution, programming language preferences, and factors influencing job satisfaction. The ultimate goal is to present these findings through a Power BI dashboard for effective visualization and decision-making.

# Scope
The scope of this project includes:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensuring the dataset is free of inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting a detailed analysis to understand the distribution of responses across various survey questions.

3. Visualization: Creating interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key insights.

4. Key Metrics: Focusing on metrics such as salary distribution by role and country, programming language preferences by industry, satisfaction levels across various factors (e.g., work-life balance), and challenges faced when transitioning into data careers.

5. Audience: The dashboard is intended for stakeholders such as HR professionals, industry analysts, and aspiring data professionals.
